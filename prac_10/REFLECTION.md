# Reflection 


_Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?_

**In my opinion, I improved and adapted to the class gradually. The feedback provided by my professor helped me immensely.**


_Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?_

**I learnt the different styles of coding and different ways of solving one problem.**

_Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?_

**Maybe I'd include more mandatory practicals.**
